# Multi-dimensional-visualizer
HyperSpace is a browser-based visualization engine built on HTML5, JavaScript (ES6), and WebGL (via the Three.js library). It uses a custom recursive perspective projection algorithm to translate complex mathematical shapes from 4, 5, and 6 dimensions down to a 3D environment that humans can see.
